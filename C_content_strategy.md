### GSC Monitoring Notes

**News traffic analysis:**
- 5,500+ impressions for time-sensitive "zendesk news" queries
- Traffic is transient (date-specific searches)
- News aggregation page is working as intended
- Don't optimise further for ephemeral queries
- Focus on evergreen "zendesk updates", "release notes", "announcements"

**Integration pattern:**
- Niche integrations showing consistent low-volume searches
- Low competition = easier ranking
- High intent = better conversion potential
- Sage/ERP integrations = enterprise budget indicators

**Migration services:**
- 13 total impressions but highly qualified traffic
- Checklist format likely to rank well (how-to intent)
- PDF download = lead capture opportunity

### Content Maintenance

**Quarterly review:**
- Update statistics and screenshots
- Refresh outdated information
- Add new features/capabilities
- Review and improve underperforming content
- Review GSC data for new opportunities

**Annual refresh:**
- Complete content audit
- Consolidate or sunset low-performers
- Identify content gaps
- Update comprehensive guides

### Cross-Linking Strategy

Create content clusters around:
- **Migration hub** → Links all migration guides
- **Integration hub** → Links all integration tutorials
- **Performance hub** → Links troubleshooting and optimisation content
- **Configuration hub** → Links all configuration management content
- **Comparison hub** → Links all vs/alternative content

Each piece should link to:
- Related articles in same cluster
- Relevant service pages
- Product pages
- Contact/demo pages

### Content Upgrades

Offer downloadable resources to capture leads:
- Migration planning checklist
- Integration decision matrix
- Configuration audit template
- Performance optimisation checklist
- Pricing comparison spreadsheet

## Notes on Search Intent Analysis

### High Commercial Intent (Direct conversion potential)
- Migration queries → Active project, budget allocated
- "How to" for complex tasks → Need expertise
- Performance problems → Pain point, urgent need
- Integration setup → Technical complexity
- "vs" comparisons → Active evaluation

### Medium Commercial Intent (Nurture required)
- "What is" queries → Education phase
- Feature explanations → Learning stage
- Use case content → Exploring fit
- Beginner guides → Early adoption

### Low Commercial Intent (Brand awareness)
- Company information → Research
- Reviews → Due diligence
- History/background → General interest

### Content Should Address Decision-Maker Concerns
- Risk mitigation
- ROI justification
- Resource requirements
- Timeline expectations
- Vendor selection criteria
- Ongoing maintenance needs

### Content Should Address Practitioner Needs
- Step-by-step instructions
- Technical accuracy
- Troubleshooting guidance
- Best practices
- Time-saving techniques
- Common pitfall avoidance

## Competitive Analysis Notes

### Likely competitors for these terms:
- Zendesk's own documentation (must differentiate with implementation expertise)
- Integration platform blogs (Zapier, Make)
- Comparison sites (G2, Capterra)
- Competitor content (Freshdesk, Intercom)
- Individual consultants/agencies

### Differentiation strategy:
- Deeper technical detail than comparison sites
- More strategic guidance than official docs
- Real-world implementation experience vs theory
- Honest about challenges and complexity
- Focus on "here's what actually happens" vs marketing
- Practical cost/benefit analysis
- Clear expertise demonstration

### Authority building:
- Use real examples from implementations
- Include actual screenshots/configurations
- Cite specific line numbers/settings
- Share common mistakes from experience
- Provide templates and checklists
- Reference specific Zendesk feature releases
- Contribute to open-source tools
