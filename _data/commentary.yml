          We've got some focused and niche updates this week. ARC still has experimental status with the IEFT (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8617/">RFC history here</a>) but Zendesk handles a huge quantity of email so implementing features seen in the wild is important.

          It's feeling like Zendesk QA (FKA Klaus) is not a priority. A long time ago I did a QA implementation project and evaluated a bunch of tools and I'm sure the competition aren't sitting still. The Tallinn office are recruiting engineers (<a href="https://linkedin.com/jobs/view/staff-software-engineer-at-zendesk-4296716374">see</a>) so we will be keeping a close eye on the future of this product.

          Tangential but I <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nicoboyce_i-got-a-bit-obsessed-with-a-couple-of-details-activity-7371300371169918976-4KWF"> wrote some notes</a> on the design of the gradients you see on this page and there's a demo <a href="https://deltastring.com/gradients/">gradient comparison tool</a> if you want to play!

          Like last week, security takes priority. It's easy to forget to disable old tokens and we see plenty of instances still allowing simple password access, even for API authentication. Drop me an email or book a call and we can talk you through some quick checks here!

          I'm still not sold on the copilot features. I have support managers ask "What is the secret to getting good value out of this?" and if you've figured this out then please do let me know. Sorry friends at Zendesk but this feature feels like it's not quite ready. Maybe these items will help?

          There has been a distinct lack of quality-of-life improvements for Zendesk admins of late. I would really like to see the config interface for the core features get brought up to date before much longer.
