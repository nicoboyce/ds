          Is your help centre performing as it should? We've done some research and see that many fail basic tests of accessibility and performance. We are now offering ready-to-go and also custom themes for Zendesk help centres, Bootstrap based and blazing fast. <a href="https://deltastring.com/themes/">Find out more!</a>

          How was the AWS outage for you? I'm glad that Zendesk and the ecosystem mostly continued as usual. If your company had problems, definitely put some time into evaluating backup options and redundancy solutions!

          Given that we've some relatively mundane updates this week I'm waving another old article in front of readers. I wrote a while ago about designing the Nico logo for my own website and you might find it interesting. It's <a href="https://nicoboyce.com/2024/05/25/where-did-the-nico-logo-design-originate/">here</a>.

          Having had a bit of a fight with Claude over weeks trying to make these summaries good on this page, I have some sympathy for whoever was responsible for the updated copilot ticket summaries. I thought the flurry of "prompt engineering" roles a couple of years ago were a cynical joke but now they have vanished I feel like I should hire one!

          It's time to renew this article <a href="https://deltastring.com/2023/10/23/contracting-is-all-in-the-prep/">Contracting is all in the preparation</a> but I'm airing it here because it keeps coming up. Colour code your gear for site visits, have backups for everything mission-critical, etc. It makes such a difference!

          This week we see a big batch of updates, primarily in the AI Agents Advanced package.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
          I know I have a reputation in this space as an AI cynic (see <a href="https://deltastring.com/2024/09/27/yes-i-hate-ai/">yes I hate AI</a>) but the important thing from my perspective is for the Zendesk platform to be the go-to solution for the businesses which will be tomorrow's giants. If copilot and AI agents help the leaders of growing support teams choose Zendesk and scale up quality service then that's what we all need to see.

          Just a couple of smaller items we want to draw your attention to this week:
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
          The Delaware court ruled in favour of the Zendesk board once again, which likely draws and end to the matter. Regular readers know we've been following the details on this one and we're glad to see a quick resolution to this latest skirmish.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
        Zendesk added a new API endpoint for incremental export of custom objects. We're glad to see proper good old fashioned APIs are still something other people care about too!
      </p>

          Voice felt like a channel on the decline for a long time, with its high costs and frustrations around reporting and triage. AI is going to be the key to make voice useful again, with smarter transcription enabling more automation. Just so long as customers can stand even more talking to machines!
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
          I've seen discussion around the Zendesk admin certification. My view is that if you compare the Zendesk offering with other platforms, like Salesforce Trailhead, it's so far short of something which would be useful to people buying or selling Zendesk services. The cert as it stands is barely more than a tax on Zendesk specialists. 
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
        I'd like to see the Zendesk community come together to establish some specific Zendesk roles, some definition of what it means to be a "Zendesk architect" or a "Zendesk engineer" and some third party way of assessing this. If developing this idea appeals to you, get in contact!

          We've got some focused and niche updates this week. ARC still has experimental status with the IEFT (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8617/">RFC history here</a>) but Zendesk handles a huge quantity of email so implementing features seen in the wild is important.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
          It's feeling like Zendesk QA (FKA Klaus) is not a priority. A long time ago I did a QA implementation project and evaluated a bunch of tools and I'm sure the competition aren't sitting still. The Tallinn office are recruiting engineers (<a href="https://linkedin.com/jobs/view/staff-software-engineer-at-zendesk-4296716374">see</a>) so we will be keeping a close eye on the future of this product.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
          Tangential but I <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nicoboyce_i-got-a-bit-obsessed-with-a-couple-of-details-activity-7371300371169918976-4KWF"> wrote some notes</a> on the design of the gradients you see on this page and there's a demo <a href="https://deltastring.com/gradients/">gradient comparison tool</a> if you want to play!

          Like last week, security takes priority. It's easy to forget to disable old tokens and we see plenty of instances still allowing simple password access, even for API authentication. Drop me an email or book a call and we can talk you through some quick checks here!
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
          I'm still not sold on the copilot features. I have support managers ask "What is the secret to getting good value out of this?" and if you've figured this out then please do let me know. Sorry friends at Zendesk but this feature feels like it's not quite ready. Maybe these items will help?
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
          There has been a distinct lack of quality-of-life improvements for Zendesk admins of late. I would really like to see the config interface for the core features get brought up to date before much longer.
