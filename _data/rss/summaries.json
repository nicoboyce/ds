  "recently_narrative": "The past three weeks have seen a flurry of activity in the Zendesk ecosystem, with the company pushing hard on AI-powered features while also grappling with a series of service incidents and stability issues. The announcement of new Copilot recommendation types and the upcoming Zendesk AI Summit suggest a strong focus on integrating artificial intelligence into the platform, even as customers have experienced problems with AI agent delays, workflow disruptions, and account integration issues. Amidst this, Zendesk has also made moves to deprecate wrappers for the Sunshine Conversations API and transition user and license management to the Admin Center, signaling broader platform changes that may impact Zendesk professionals. The juxtaposition of innovation and instability underscores the challenges Zendesk faces in delivering a seamless customer experience as it navigates the evolving landscape of AI-powered contact centers.",

Additionally, the default content for the welcome email has been updated for new accounts. The Copilot add-on has also been expanded with 15 new recommendation types.",
