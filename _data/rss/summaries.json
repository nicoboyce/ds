  "recently_narrative": "Over the past three weeks, Zendesk has been actively enhancing its platform with a strong focus on AI-powered features, such as intelligent triage for voice calls and a reported 30% faster response time after integrating GPT-5. However, this push for innovation has been accompanied by some stability issues, including service incidents and access problems, which Zendesk has been working to address. The company is also making strategic decisions, such as shuttering its Zendesk Sell product to focus solely on customer service, while integrating its platform with external tools like the AWS Support API. These updates suggest Zendesk is positioning itself as a leader in the AI-powered contact center era, but it must balance this ambition with ensuring a reliable and seamless customer experience for its users.",
