This suggests that Zendesk administrators need to closely monitor the stability and performance of these critical components, prioritize proactive maintenance and testing, and have robust incident response and communication plans in place to minimize disruptions to customer service operations.\n\nAdditionally, the titles indicate that Zendesk is aggressively expanding its AI capabilities, which may be contributing to the observed stability issues.
