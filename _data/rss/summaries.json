  "recently_narrative": "Over the past three weeks, Zendesk has been actively expanding its ecosystem with a focus on AI-powered features and integrations. The company has announced several new capabilities, including intelligent triage for voice calls, AI-powered pricing models, and GPT-5 integration for faster response times. However, this period has also seen Zendesk grapple with service incidents and stability issues, such as agent access problems and 5xx errors.

For Zendesk professionals, this highlights the need to closely monitor the platform's performance and stability, while also exploring the potential benefits of the new AI-driven features and integrations.",
