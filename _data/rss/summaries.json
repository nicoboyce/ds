The most significant operational pattern that administrators need to understand is the rapid expansion of AI-powered features and capabilities within the Zendesk platform, as evidenced by the numerous announcements related to AI-driven ticket categorization, real-time suggestions, and QA insights.\n\n2. This indicates that Zendesk is heavily investing in AI technology to enhance its customer service offerings, which means administrators will need to closely monitor the implementation and performance of these AI features, ensure proper testing and integration, and be prepared to adapt their workflows and processes to leverage the new AI-powered capabilities effectively.",

    "summary": "The release notes include the following specific changes:\n\nA new, modernized version of the ticket settings page is now available in Admin Center, with a streamlined layout and new features and controls for managing ticketing configurations. The default automation responsible for transitioning tickets from Solved to Closed has been updated to find tickets throughout the hour, not just at the top of the hour. Record-level permissions on custom objects with Access Rules have been introduced.\n\nIn the Dialogue Builder, select inputs have been replaced by Zendesk Garden components, and templates now work when the messaging toggle is activated. The limits for excluded terms in AI translation for articles have been increased from 50 to 300, and Admins can now understand their auto assist procedure performance directly from the procedure page in Knowledge admin. Automated resolutions for accounts in pod 19 were not being counted for autoreplies based on intelligent triage from July 17 to August 29, but this issue has been remediated. Copilot introduced 15 new recommendation types for refunds and escalations, macro suggestions in auto-assist procedures, and conversation summarisation for Slack channels.",
