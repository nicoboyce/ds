  "recently_narrative": "Over the past three weeks, Zendesk has been aggressively pushing its AI-powered capabilities, announcing features like intelligent triage for voice calls and a 30% faster response time after integrating GPT-5. However, this AI-focused strategy has been accompanied by a series of service incidents, including AI agent delays and QA access issues, suggesting that Zendesk is still grappling with stability challenges as it transitions towards a more AI-centric contact center approach. Additionally, the company has announced the deprecation of wrappers for the Sunshine Conversations API, as well as changes to ticket-closing automation, indicating a broader shift in its product roadmap. These updates, coupled with the news of Zendesk's decision to shutter its Sell CRM offering, paint a picture of a company in flux, balancing its ambitions for AI-powered customer service with the need to address underlying platform reliability concerns.",
