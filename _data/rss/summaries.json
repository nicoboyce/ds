  "recently_narrative": "The Zendesk ecosystem has seen a flurry of updates in the past three weeks, with a strong focus on AI-powered features and improvements to agent productivity and customer experience. Zendesk is pushing the boundaries of its platform, announcing new AI-driven capabilities like intelligent triage for voice calls, as well as integrations with other CRM tools like Pipedrive. However, the company has also had to grapple with service incidents and stability issues, including delays in AI agent responses and access problems.
