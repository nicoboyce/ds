  "recently_narrative": "Over the past three weeks, Zendesk has been aggressively pushing its AI capabilities, with announcements around intelligent triage for voice calls, AI-powered contact center features, and impressive performance gains from GPT-5 integration. However, this AI-focused strategy has been accompanied by a series of service incidents, including access issues, 5xx errors, and AI agent delays, suggesting that Zendesk is still grappling with stability challenges as it rapidly innovates. Additionally, the company has announced the deprecation of certain API wrappers and the shuttering of its Zendesk Sell product, signaling a shift in focus towards its core customer service offerings.
