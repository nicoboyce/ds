    title: "Don't Pay Agent Salaries for Robot Work"
    text: "The best processes get out of the way of productivity"
    body: "Are your agents constantly flipping between second—even third—screens? Their routine of endless ctrl-c and ctrl-v is a productivity sink, wasting time and efficiency just to get data where it needs to be. <br /><br />We streamline that process. Our [Zendesk integrations](/zendesk-integration) and [automation solutions](/customer-experience-automation) connect your Zendesk directly to the systems responsible for decision-making. No more manual data wrangling, just pure, efficient workflows that power your business. <br /><br />Agents forget they are navigating Zendesk but instead just see themselves as talking to customers, solving problems. Explore our [comprehensive resources](/resources) or book a meeting with us and see efficiency transformed."
