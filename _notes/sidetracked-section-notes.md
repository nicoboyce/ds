## In defence of getting sidetracked

I think a healthy way to live is to give yourself permission to get sidetracked. Get the job done, but on each item build in the scope to get really deep into a niche aspect. When I do this, something good usually emerges.

You've probably heard of the 20% time 

Even if there's no immediate reward, just knowing more and documenting what you discover will always come back around and be useful. When I started designing the Deltastring logo there was an argument that it wasn't a good use of time to get into the maths and the xml. The structure of SVG files is great for building stuff on the web! You can move things around with javascript or scale it to the size of the moon. When it came to putting together ideas for the Beacon logo, it was straightforward to iterate until we had this, which I like a lot.

### Sidetracked section expansion:
- Google's 20% time -> Gmail, AdSense
- Need buffers for deep investigations
- Examples:
  - Deltastring logos: handmade SVGs (XML-based format, can use inline, JavaScript, standard XML features)
  - Gradients testing: https://deltastring.com/gradients/ (used on /news/ page)

### Structure options for narrative flow:
- **Corporate → Personal → Corporate**: Start with Google 20% time, move to your logo work, end with broader business implications
- **Problem → Examples → Solution**: Open with why people avoid sidetracks, give examples (Google, your work), conclude with how to build it into workflow
- **Historical → Present → Future**: Google's past innovation, your current approach, what businesses could gain
- **Scale progression**: Big company (Google) → Small company (you) → Individual projects → Back to business value
- **Question-driven**: Why do we resist? (Google proved otherwise) What does it look like? (your examples) How to implement?

### Possible conclusions:
- Building systematic time for exploration into business processes
- Permission vs structure - when sidetracks become strategic
- The compound value of documented discoveries

### Section structure bones:
1. **Personal opening**: Deltastring logo work - going deep into SVG/XML when others said it wasn't worth the time
2. **External validation**: Google's 20% time policy → Gmail, AdSense (major products from "sidetracks")
3. **Current application**: Gradients testing work, other recent tangents that paid off
4. **Implementation framework**: 
   - Guardrails: time boundaries, documentation requirements
   - Identifying worthwhile tangents: curiosity + potential compound value
   - Making it systematic rather than accidental

## Additional content - Kaizen approach

In everything I do each day I keep this one thing in mind...

The goal of today is to make tomorrow better than yesterday.

Being a small agency means being hands on with decisions across such a broad range of functions. Join an established company and they already know how all the business-as-usual happens.

When we come across problems in our processes, we solve the immediate issue but we also say "how do we prevent this next time?" and also "how can we simplify and reduce the risk and effort?"

The things we do for clients, automating and streamlining and integrating, we put it in all we do too.

It continues through to how I maintain myself. Kaizen
