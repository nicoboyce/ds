It's been a lot of work (and will no doubt continue to be a lot of work) but I'm happy to share the cover for my upcoming book. What do you think?

*Book cover.*

Assembling the fragments collected over years of doing Zendesk into some sort of logical order hasn't exactly been a straightforward business.<!--excerpt-end--> There are so many good Zendesk resources out there but I was keen to do something a bit different with this. I'm considering this an old-fashioned book of recipes, containing plenty of techniques and concepts which you can make your own.

I look forward to sharing more with the Zendesk community in due course.
