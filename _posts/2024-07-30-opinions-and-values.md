title: "We value your opinion"
---

It's okay as a small business, as a contractor, as a supplier, to be opinionated. It's okay to bring those opinions to the table talking to clients.

The next step is the key step.

Decide what happens if the client takes the opposite position and will not budge.

With anything you meet head on in life, you can consider whether you can make a change happen or if it is outside of your power.

With those things you cannot change, you can either accept them as they are or walk away.

Differences of opinion where you can accept the alternative perspective, these are straightforward to deal with. Sometimes accepting one means that you can use this as leverage or a demonstration of good faith to get what you need elsewhere.

If you cannot accept the change, it sounds like this is actually a value for you. For example, I worked with a client who, in backlog, deprioritised tickets of a safeguarding nature. I looked at those tickets and decided this was a line I wasn't prepared to cross. This is a value and actually a powerful asset to the small business.

Your values are the primary differentiator with your larger competitors. Strong values demonstrate self-belief. Strong values show you are in a position of strength, you have sufficient headroom to say no to the bad fit.

Google once had the maxim "Don't be evil" but it's 2024, we can do better than that. Let's leave things better than we found them.

### It's okay to just be good.
