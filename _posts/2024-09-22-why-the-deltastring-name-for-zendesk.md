title: Why are we called Deltastring?
meta: My rules for naming companies in tech.

Sometimes I get asked about how I named the company. It's not an easy thing to do. Here's what I thought about.

Deltastring Ltd isn't my first company. I previously had a business in the restaurant trade<!--excerpt-end--> which I closed down at the end of 2019. I gave that company a name which was personal to me. I think names have a lot of influence over how we feel about things, and I would have liked to feel less bad about the end of that endeavour.

### Simple rules

Here are the rules I came up with for my new company name.

* The .com must be available.
* The company name must be made of existing real words.
* These words must have no homophones.
* The spelling must be unambiguous.
* The name should make sense with what we do.

I broke almost all of these rules with my first business. You get sick of having to spell out your email address, correcting people over and over.

### Rule the first

> The .com must be available.

If you're looking for the web presence for company XYZ then you're almost certainly going to do one of two things. You're going to type "xyz.com" into your browser address bar or you're going to type "xyz" into your address bar and it will display the results for "xyz" in your search engine of choice.

Search engines usually rank the domain xyz.com highly as a search result for xyz, for any given value of xyz.

Someone looking for you needs to be able to find you, quickly and easily.

Furthermore, owning the .com gives a sense of authority and some confidence for your future customers. Would you click on a link to my site if it was deltastring.biz or deltastring.app or something unusual?

I worked at igloo.energy and at hofy.co but one of those later went and bought the .com of their name and one of them didn't. Guess which one was a success?

### Rule the second

> The company name must be made of existing real words.

Have you ever worked at a company where the name was a portmanteau or acronym or something with no obvious meaning or pronounciation? I certainly have. Sometimes you become huge and your name enters the public lexicon. I'm talking Ebay or Google type thing. Mostly you're not ever big enough that people stop asking how it's pronounced.

Again, Hofy is an example of this one. Depop was another place I worked that broke this rule. Did it work for them? Both were acquired by larger companies which also break this rule: Deel and Etsy respectively.

There are no single word .com domains available for real English words, so I needed a two word name. I generated some lists and checked DNS servers for those domains.

### Rule the third

> These words must have no homophones.

Here are some top-of-my-head bad names to illustrate this. Don't call your company Weightlist or Ritestuff or Fishtales even if these choices are semantically relevant.

### Rule the fourth

> The spelling must be unambiguous.

This covers a range of pitfalls. Colour or color, so language variants and dialects. Adviser or advisor, you can see why Resident Advisor changed their URL to [ra.co](https://ra.co) though of course this breaks rule one!

### Rule the fifth

This one is important.

> The name should make sense with what we do.

It's a terrible company, but Facebook.com is basically the ultimate example of how to do this right. Their domain was originally thefacebook.com and I think it was obviously wise to lose the "the" early on!

Delta is a symbol used in maths and sciences to denote a change or difference in something. It's in the NATO phonetic alphabet precisely because it is an easy word to identify from its sound. Much of what I do is about finding the differences between objects, usually in API exports.

A string, in this sense, is a data type containing a series of characters. There's a more thorough description on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)) should you want that.

The Deltastring name jumped out at me from the list of available two word .com domains and I'm still happy with it. What do you think?

#### addendum

After publishing this it occurred to me that I read something similar from Paul Graham many years ago, which is still online [here](https://paulgraham.com/name.html).

As I recall Paul Graham persuaded justin.tv to change their name to twitch.com and I think that worked out okay for them?
