People asked what we are all about. We're happy to explain.

### We don't think the unthinkable.

No one does. Let's focus and be realistic.

### We don't do the impossible.

We can't, so we stick to the possible.

### We don't attack the hard problems head on.

Harder heads can do that. We break those problems up into sensible chunks and attack those.

### We don't invent.

We design, we engineer, we build, we solve.

### Forget implementing quick and dirty solutions.

They are quick once but dirty forever.

### Software is inherently opinionated.

Your users' feelings are within the design scope.

### Don't Be Evil never went far enough.

Let's just do good.

### The customer shouldn't have to reverse engineer your processes.

Come to them where they need you.
