title: "Deltastring Editorial: Why the Internet Archive shows Zendesk is still the right choice"
meta: For all its flaws, Zendesk is the mature support ecosystem.

Readers will be well aware of the battle with hackers the Internet Archive has faced over recent days. Distracted with legal challenges, the venerable web institution inadvertently exposed an access token and suddenly had miscreants taunting them from within their own systems.

<em>How secure is your Zendesk?</em></p>

The resulting mess caused a flood of bad press for the IA but also for Zendesk as every tech blog pointed fingers and blamed the victims. It's important for the tech world to hold vendors for account if they ship insecure products. It's also important to recognise that a lock is only secure until you leave the key lying around.<!--excerpt-end-->

### What were the consequences?

Zendesk didn't hang around here. They helped the Internet Archive cycle their keys, revoke access to the rogue accounts, get their system back to a good state. No doubt they were aware of the reputational risk, but my sense as someone not connected to this incident is that Zendesk were good citizens of the internet here.

That isn't to say that everything is back to usual for the IA users. The cleanup process, informing users of compromised data, will be a challenge. The beleaguered Internet Archive itself won't forget the incident in a hurry.

### Don't let this be you!

The positive of choosing a mature ecosystem such as Zendesk is that the resources and expertise is out there. Maybe your business could pinch the pennies and find a cheaper, more basic alternative. Will they pick up the phone and bail you out when there's a disaster? Will you find consultants out there like ourselves who can proactively audit your security configuration?

At Deltastring we have provided security audits for the Zendesk instances of some of our major clients. We don't treat this as a box ticking exercise. Certainly there have been times where the client representative has not liked what they read in our report! We're not coming in to help you direct blame and to cause panic, instead we systematically guide you towards a better state. Always use external consultants for your security audits, because they can be dispassionate and objective about legacy decisions your business carries.

The Internet Archive have made some big mistakes recently but choosing Zendesk for their support platform was the right move. I am sure they wish they could rewind time and buy a security audit. If your business hasn't had an inspection from Zendesk specialists recently, consider this a reminder. Make headlines for your incredible customer service, not for security breaches.
