Hello. How are you? It's definitely summer now here in Hampshire, which affects highly seasonal businesses in different ways. If your busy period is winter, you'll be looking ahead and focusing on preparation. If summer is your busiest time then you'll be thinking about the here and now and also the recent past. Did you make the right changes over the last few months?

In my previous career in the pub trade, my mentor Stuart liked to be making plenty of cash all year round. His was very much a winter pub, so he invested in some summer opportunities each year to keep his team busy. We're talking a bottle shop near the beach, beer festivals, that sort of thing.

It's true with the economy too. Some businesses thrive in a rising market. Others have methods to grow in generally more difficult times. We also see this phenomena on a smaller scale as users net shift between a duopoly, such as to and from Apple products. Phone accessory manufacturers don't mind that at all!

At Deltastring we think of it this way: some bet on the tide coming in and some bet on the tide going out but the real energy is in the back and forth of the waves.

I guess this is a long-winded way of encouraging you to look at how you can make the most of the opportunities that exist for you, using winter rather than wishing for summer all year round!

## Feature creep

The comment from [Gareth Elsby on this post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7335239341721468930) had me thinking about documentation.

If no one knows that something can be done then it might as well not be possible.

Zendesk is a huge and mighty platform and even the most experienced of Zendesk specialists are learning all the time. Earlier I mentioned to someone "oh you can check the IPs page" but they had never known about `[subdomain].zendesk.com/ips` and I'm sure there are still things like that I don't know yet.

What's the solution? As always, I think the ecosystem should solve this problem with some collaboration. If someone starts a Zendesk wiki then I have plenty of material for it already!

## It's pride month

Be kind to your queer friends (of all flavours) because it's a tough old world lately. Challenge businesses who post pinkwashing adverts "Can you say trans women are women?" and please choose to speak up when something needs to be said.

## We are all systems go with our product launch

In the spirit of "be the change you want to see" or whatever the phrase is, we are gearing up to welcome paying users into our SaaS product which we've used internally for some time.

It's called Beacon and we hope it will revolutionise Zendesk maintenance for support leaders who are juggling other responsibilities. Take a look at this and see what you think!
