Hello! We're keeping it lightweight today. I don't think I've ever had a busier fortnight than between the last Moral Support and now as I sit down to write this in the new house, in between calls on new projects. At least the weather has improved and I haven't needed the Zendesk umbrella so much.

Thanks to everyone I've had a call with over the last week or so for making the same "I see you unpacked the important things" joke seeing the rack of guitars in frame. You should check out the new album! You can't be all work and no play, so yes, the laptops and the guitars moved first.

Anyway, back to business.

## The big results are still made up of all the little changes

We've got a real interesting mix of clients right now, from new to old, from utilities to cutting edge tech, from enormous corporations to two-pizza orgs. Yet the same is true in all of these businesses. Big results come from many tiny changes.

I enjoy a big migration project, these so-called "digital transformation" events. It's great to see agents jumping into a Zendesk instance feeling unshackled from the limitations of how they were previously working. Here's what the sales people don't tell you though. The real power of these projects is that it's a good opportunity to abandon all the legacy workflows and go back to basics, rebuilding your processes for tomorrow rather than yesterday.

Here's a video I like and you should watch where I talk about our approach to process design.

If you're not sure where to start with a fresh round of modernising, it's almost certainly reporting. Get really good data and the opportunities present themselves!

Sometimes you need to get that data in front of people who are going to have trouble making a habit of checking a dashboard. I was glad to be able to help out this Support Driven user with a tiny piece of useful info!

*A helpful tip for getting reporting data in front of the right people*

The work we do at Deltastring is built on a few thousand of these tiny pieces of knowledge across Zendesk and dozens of other products. I'm sure it's the same at your company. Why not set up a little channel in your Slack (or Teams or wherever) for surfacing the little tips and hacks that make everyone's work easier? Then make sure to review and collate and archive periodically.

## New structure at Deltastring

Today we're making the first of a series of announcements about organisational change here at Deltastring Ltd.

My fellow founder Rosie Elliott-Welch is stepping away from the day-to-day contract services work and into the position of CEO of Deltastring. Rosie will continue to own all the background processes. My job title will change to CTO and we're going to look to fill other roles through the coming weeks and months as well as continue to work with our freelance network.

This change reflects the shift in emphasis from being a provider of technical consulting services to being a business with an offering including these services but also providing products and tools and potentially managed services and outsourced processes.

Now I've got my office mostly reassembled watch this space for more news on Beacon, the Deltastring tool for Zendesk configuration management.

Have a great week, may all your CSATs be positive!
