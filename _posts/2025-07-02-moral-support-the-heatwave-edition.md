Hello Zendeskers! By Zendesker I mean people whose work is primarily based around operating a Zendesk instance. Did you know internally at Zendesk they call the team Zendeskians? But of course not all Zendeskians are Zendeskers according to my definition a couple of sentences ago. You can draw your own Venn diagram if you so wish.

I hope you're keeping cool if you're somewhere this heatwave is happening. My Scottish genes didn't equip me for summer. There's a bit of a breeze in a certain spot but if I work there I seem to be targeted by bees. Maybe the Deltastring orange colour scheme looks floral to this swarm? Anyway I will keep this one brief!

Back to Venn diagrams which have been a theme for me this week as two of our projects have involved untangling legacy trigger conditions. We're lucky to work with great clients and swarms of smart engineers but everyone gets muddled with their any and all conditions occasionally. We talked them each through it with the aid of Venn and redesigned the process for the new channels and workflows.

Side note: if ever you're passing through Cambridge, see if the porters will let you take a look at the Gonville & Caius college dining hall, where the windows commemorate John Venn, Francis Crick, alongside other Caius alumni.

Here's another set theory intersection. Consider the people within your company and the people within a competitor and the links between. There will be some connections usually! Do your competitors deal with similar challenges? If they did, would you be able to collaborate?

However, there are companies who aren't competing with you who do share similar problems. They might have good solutions for things which are causing you headaches! Is there any crossover between these companies? Who is in the intersection of that Venn diagram?

That's your implementation consultants. We go business to business and we cross-pollinate ideas and solutions and processes and also introduce people or other vendors. It's in the nature of what we do!

Consider ways you can contribute to or benefit from sharing and collaborating. For those of use who are Zendeskers or indeed Zendeskians, everyone wins when we can build on good solutions and exchange ways to get the best out of our tools.

I'm off to grab something in the intersection of caffeinated and ice cold and delicious, then get back to some solution design. Have a productive week!
