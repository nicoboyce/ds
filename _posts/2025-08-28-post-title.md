# How are you?

Let’s normalise just saying “How are you?” instead of “I hope you’re well” which really means “Don’t you tell me about your problems” doesn’t it?

At Deltastring we start from the position “Good customer service is its own reward” and then when the processes are good our clients can use the enhanced data, the released agent capacity, the fresh insights from the customers, however they see fit. “How are you?” is a part of this. Not that vague of course, but we can absolutely throw in “How are you finding the product?” type questions.

Businesses worry about asking open questions, or inviting negativity. When I had restaurants, I always instructed my teams against asking closed or assumptive questions. We’re not afraid of hearing where we can do better. When someone has something to say, they are giving us the gift of an opportunity to act and improve. If they aren’t happy, thank them! I’m so grateful you shared this with us. It’s only through the honesty that we can continue to improve.

We don’t always get things right, and neither do you. Being perfect isn’t the goal. Being better tomorrow than we were yesterday, that’s what today is about. So how are you?

## In defence of getting sidetracked

I think a healthy way to live is to give yourself permission to get sidetracked. Get the job done, but on each item build in the scope to get really deep into a niche aspect. When I do this, something good usually emerges.

Even if there's no immediate reward, just knowing more
