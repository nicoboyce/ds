# Deltastring build Zendesk solutions.

You bring the Zendesk, we'll bring the solutions. We're talking new processes, new integrations, auxiliary services. We'll export and document and leave you feeling good about your tooling.

### What is your process? How do you work best?

We have a [methodology](https://deltastring.com/2024/05/22/unlock-zendesk-with-deltastring/) you can read about. We also have a [manifesto](https://deltastring.com/manifesto/). We have a stack of laptops, plenty of war stories, phones full of contacts, and a big ol' archive of scripts and processes and hopes and dreams.

### So who are you?

>"Nico is London's best teacher of Zendesk" 

*—Jake Samson, Systems Manager at HyperJar*

Our founder is Nico Boyce. You can read more about Nico on [this page](https://deltastring.com/nico/) or even more on his personal website [nicoboyce.com](https://nicoboyce.com). He is the leader of Deltastring and the writer of the [Zendesk Cookbook](https://deltastring.com/2024/07/29/well-read/). Nico primarily focuses on the technical and engineering side of things. Our team is small but growing. We have some top freelancers in the Deltastring family with expertise across operations and CX functions, specifically UAT, processes, and data.
