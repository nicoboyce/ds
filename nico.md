# Nico Boyce is the leader of Deltastring Ltd.

Nico has been hacking and building software since the mid nineties, starting out with a scavenged Zenith SupersPort and a Nokia 2110. An early project was porting an ELIZA implementation, found on an old 5¼" floppy, over to TI Basic. Find another Zendesk engineer with over 25 years experience building chatbots!

He studied photonics at the University of Southampton before taking a hard left with his career and working in the world of bars and restaurants for a decade. Now he operates Deltastring and also is the author and maintainer of the [Zendesk Cookbook](https://deltastring.com/2024/07/29/well-read/).

> "Nico Boyce is a powerful source of knowledge in the Zendesk community"

*—Jason McDonald, Zendesk User Group leader*

In the super-competitive Hampshire hospitality trade, Nico quickly gained a reputation as an expert buyer of alcohol and as a data-led restaurateur with an eye for efficiency. His company had contracts with local producers, UK market leaders, and international giants. His team operated pubs and restaurants, off-license retailers and events. After achieving multiple TripAdvisor certificates and CAMRA awards, Nico made the decision to switch careers and bring his CX and data experience to other industries.

### Nico Boyce and Zendesk

Zendesk fell at the intersection between Nico's work passions: using data to guide continuous improvement of customer experience with engineering solutions. His recent clients include London unicorns Checkout.com and Starling Bank, S&P 500 component Etsy, along with various smaller scale B2B and B2C startups, each of which had their own distinct set of Zendesk opportunities.

Outside of work, Nico keeps busy creating and performing across a range of artistic disciplines. His personal website is [nicoboyce.com](https://nicoboyce.com) where you can find out more.
