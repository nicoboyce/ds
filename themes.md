## Your help centre isn't performing as well as it could

We see it constantly. Companies spending millions on their brand, building beautiful websites, then using Zendesk's default theme and assuming it's optimised. It isn't.

Your help centre is often the first place frustrated customers land. If it's slow or difficult to navigate, you're making their day worse. That costs you money in tickets, damages your brand, and creates accessibility issues.

Even Zendesk's own default theme can't hit perfect Lighthouse scores:

*Copenhagen - Zendesk's default theme. Close, but not optimal.*

## This is a widespread problem

Even major tech companies and Zendesk themselves struggle to achieve optimal help centre performance:

![Zendesk's own help centre](/assets/img/lighthouse/zendesk.png)
*Zendesk's own help centre: 79 performance.*

![Dropbox help centre](/assets/img/lighthouse/dropbox.png)
*Dropbox: 59 performance, 77 accessibility.*

![Squarespace help centre](/assets/img/lighthouse/squarespace.png)
*Squarespace: 69 performance, 78 best practices.*

These aren't terrible scores. But they're leaving performance on the table. And that has real consequences:

**Accessibility gaps.** Missing ARIA labels, broken keyboard navigation, poor colour contrast. You're excluding customers and risking compliance issues.

**Slower than necessary.** Bloated JavaScript, unoptimised assets, render-blocking CSS. Your help centre is fundamentally text and search, but it's loading like a complex web application.

**Mobile experience suffers.** Responsive doesn't mean optimised. Most themes work on mobile, but they're not fast or pleasant to use.

**SEO penalties.** Google cares about page speed and accessibility. Sub-optimal Lighthouse scores affect how your help articles rank.

All of this hurts deflection. When customers can't find answers quickly, they submit tickets. Your agents get swamped. Your metrics suffer.

## We rebuilt Bootstrap 5 for Zendesk

We took Bootstrap 5, stripped out everything Zendesk doesn't need, optimised what remained, and built a proper theme framework.

The result: perfect Lighthouse scores across all metrics. Performance, accessibility, best practices, SEO. All 100.

*This is what your help centre can achieve. When you get a perfect score, Chrome gives you fireworks in celebration.*

### What this actually means

**Proper ARIA implementation.** Screen readers work correctly. Keyboard navigation makes sense. Colour contrast passes WCAG AAA standards.

**Mobile-first design.** Not responsive as an afterthought. Built for mobile screens first, enhanced for desktop.

**Optimised performance.** Fast loading times even on poor connections. We've stripped out the bloat that makes most help centres sluggish.

**Modern aesthetic.** Bootstrap 5 is a solid foundation for matching your main website's design. Your help centre can actually look like it belongs to your company.

**SEO benefits.** Google cares about page speed and accessibility. Perfect Lighthouse scores help your help articles rank properly.
