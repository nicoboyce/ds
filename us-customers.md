# Working with US Companies

## Seamless Collaboration Across the Atlantic

Deltastring Ltd has extensive experience working with **American businesses**, providing the same **enterprise-grade Zendesk services** whether you're based in San Francisco, New York, or anywhere across the United States.

### Tax Documentation & Compliance

**W8-BEN-E Forms** - We provide properly completed W8-BEN-E tax forms to ensure compliance with US tax reporting requirements. This confirms our foreign entity status and helps streamline your accounting processes.

**UK Business Registration** - Deltastring Ltd is registered in England and Wales (Company Number: 14503277), providing clear legal entity status for your procurement and vendor management processes.

### Currency & Billing

**USD Invoicing** - We bill American clients directly in **US Dollars**, eliminating foreign exchange complications and simplifying your accounting.

**Net 30 Payment Terms** - Standard payment terms align with American business practices, with invoices processed through established international payment channels.

### Time Zone Coordination

**Overlap Hours** - Our Southampton team maintains morning overlap with US East Coast business hours, typically 8:00 AM - 12:00 PM EST for real-time collaboration. As a small agency, we can be flexible here where required.

**Asynchronous Workflow** - Most Zendesk optimization, migration, and automation work doesn't require constant coordination. We structure projects to maximize progress during UK hours while keeping you informed.

**Meeting Scheduling** - Video consultations available during mutually convenient times, typically mornings GMT which align with US afternoon/evening hours.

### Service Delivery

**Remote-First Operations** - All services delivered virtually, which we've perfected working with UK clients from **London to Bristol**. Geographic distance doesn't impact service quality.

**Project Management** - Clear milestone tracking and regular updates ensure project visibility regardless of timezone differences.

**Documentation Standards** - All deliverables provided in formats compatible with US business requirements.

### Data & Security

**International Data Transfers** - Experienced with data privacy requirements for US-UK business relationships, ensuring Zendesk configurations meet both GDPR and relevant US compliance standards.

**Secure Communication** - All client communications conducted through encrypted channels with proper data handling protocols.

### Why US Companies Choose Deltastring

- **Zendesk migrations** from legacy systems
- **Customer experience automation**
- **Custom integrations** and applications
- **Optimization** of existing Zendesk setups

### Contract & Legal

**English Law Jurisdiction** - Contracts governed by English law, which provides clear legal framework for international business relationships.

**Professional Indemnity Insurance** - Full coverage protecting both parties in the business relationship.

**Clear Terms of Service** - Transparent service agreements with defined deliverables and timelines.

### Getting Started
